# Cypher
Cypher is an open-source Project, aiming to create a decentralized Live-Messenger. For this to work, there needs to be a Network of Computers, called "Nodes", that communicate with each other. To make it attractive for people to run a Node, there is a cryptocurrency called "Cypher". In one Cypher there are 1000 "milliCypher" or "mCypher". 1000 Cypher are refered to as one "KCypher" or "KiloCypher". Nodes can earn Cypher by contributing to the Network, and putting some amount of Cypher at risk. This process is called "staking".

The Cypher Project does not stop with providing this decentralized infrastructure and Live-Messenger. There are already more projects in the works, that will be released as a certain progress is reached.

This repository contains the source code for the official Cypher Wallet Application, written in JavaScript/TypeScript with Electron, ReactJS and TailwindCSS.

# Contribute
